# TODO:
+ Standardize SMILES strings by converting the given smiles to mol in rdkit and back to SMILES
+ Generate the enantiomers for all the smiles and check if already exists in the dataset

# Obselete TODO:
- Resume calculations based on _property file
- Replace smiles atoms with oxidation numbers for transition metals to only the metal. I.e. Rh3 -> Rh
- Optimize the geometry of xyz files
